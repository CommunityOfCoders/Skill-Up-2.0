## Overview of the Idea

The availability of chat apps in the market is extensive. Although, many of them are clones of preexisting chatting applications. Over time, we all have found some intermediary ways to do specific tasks that the current chat app cannot provide. The main aim of our project is to develop an application that will be extensively providing better features. Unlike other tangible chat applications available, **Baatein** not only brings about communication but also has a lot more in store. It is available on android devices as well as on the web, so you can find and access it whether you are on your desk or on the go! We have developed both  web and mobile apps for desktop and mobile phone users. The data will be synced across the devices.


## Feature Details
### 1) Chatting with Friends
The very obvious feature without which chat app will lose its essence. We can chat with our friends and contacts(from the phone’s contact list). The user can send or receive text msgs and images. Make the best of your time here with us with our beautiful UI and flawless user experience. Fast messaging on both website and app simultaneously never looked so easy! Join us to streamline all your conversations and much more coming soon.

### 2) Personal Space
Every user gets a personal space to save/store important messages, To-Dos etc. This space will only be accessed by the authorized user. Tick off your editable ToDo list and make progress on your projects, assignments or any other tasks. Delete and edit them as you like it! Boost your productivity and organize your tasks in one place with ‘Baatein’!

### 3) Avatars
Avatars for users to give the app a fresher and millenial look and feel. Users can select from a range of avatars and that will be visible to his/her contacts. It can be changed at any time.

## Future Scope
Baatein may be the simplest of applications right now but we assure you a bright future of this application. We will be looking to implement additional features like group chats, peer to peer audio and video calling etc. Scheduling messages will also be a part of the future development process. Stay tuned! Other planned features are:

### 1) Birthday Reminder
The app will suggest birthday reminders to users’ contacts/friends. The user can schedule a message wishing the birthday person.

### 2) Pop-up notifications with reply suggestions
The app’s notification/pop-up notification will give the user a suggestive reply message for messages that start with “Hi” or “Hello” from another user.

### 3) Store important links
The users often get important links. Everyone cannot read links to get an idea of what the link is about. There will be a place in our app to mark important links, and the application will store a reference to that link in the form of an image of that site.

## What we learnt through this project?

* Asavari : 
> I had the privilege of working on this project with the most hardworking and dedicated bunch of people. Since I worked on the mobile app part of the project, I gained a substantial amount of knowledge about app development in flutter which was a very novel concept for me. Along with this, I also learned how to use and operate the firebase console and the process of integrating it with flutter. Apart from the tutorials and project work, I definitely learned a lot from my team too.

* Maitri : 
> I worked on the web application of the Baatein project. I learnt about the frontend and backend frameworks along with its integration in the website. Explored and used npm packages in ReactJS like materialUI which helped in making a beautiful UI. In the backend part, I learned about data management in Cloud Firestore along with authentication of users. Lastly, I had an amazing experience working with the team and learned a lot from my fellow teammates.



* Ruchika:
> Even I worked on the web application part of Baatein. I focused more on the frontend part and hence I primarily learnt and explored ReactJS. Along with that I learnt about other important npm packages like MaterialUI,React Router. I have definitely improved my "development" skills and I'd like to thank the entire team for being so committed, patient and all of them were yet so diligent.



* Abhay:
> “Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships”. I had great fun working with the team and learned a lot of new things from them. As a team leader, I got to know how decision making can be made effective by discussions. I got to learn React JS which was completely new to me. I continued it till I got comfortable with the MERN stack. Integrating both web and app versions was tricky but we managed. I would like to thank my team for such wonderful work!
