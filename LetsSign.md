## Description
Sign Language Interpreter has several features. Each of the features aims at making communication easy. Features include a camera which when aimed at a person communicating using sign language, will display a textual interpretation of that to the user in real time, so that the user can understand what is being communicated to him. 
Also during these tough times of the pandemic, it is not feasible to meet someone in person. All we have is the support of video calls. So we have also implemented a feature where if two people are on a video call and one is communicating through sign language, the interpretation will be displayed on call as text.
Lastly, it is also quite feasible with our app to learn sign language. This you can do with the learning feature of our app. Here you can input words or sentences and get their visual representations of sign language as output. Making it easy to master sign language and break all the barriers.
