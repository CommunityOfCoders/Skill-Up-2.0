## Project Description
Equation solver enables users to solve handwritten equations. The scanned image can be in any colour format (The colour of the background and digits can be according to the users convenience). We are still working on its webapp. The users for now can solve the equations on a local machine. The digit and operator recognition is done by our ML model which we have built using our knowledge of CNN, Tensorflow and OpenCV. The detected equation is solved using python libraries.

## Tech Stack
* CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
* Tensorflow
* Python
* OpenCV

## Future Scope:
For now we are running and testing on local machine. Our future goals are:
 * To improve the accuracy of prediction of our ML model.
 * To deploy our project in form of a web-app.
